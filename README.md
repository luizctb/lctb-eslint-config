# My Custom ESLint Project


This is a custom ESLint package I've developed to facilitate code standardization and quality in my projects, especially in Next.js and React projects. The package includes a set of rules and configurations that have been carefully selected and tailored to meet specific development needs.

## Features

- Specific configurations for Next.js, React, and TypeScript projects.
- Integration with Prettier to ensure consistent code formatting.
- Recommended rules for JavaScript and TypeScript.
- Support for automatic detection of React versions.
- JSX-a11y accessibility configurations to ensure an accessible user experience.


## Installation

To use this ESLint package in your own project, you can install it via npm:


npm install lctb-eslint-config

## Usage

After installation, you can configure ESLint in your project by adding a .eslintrc.js or .eslintrc.json file with the following configuration:

module.exports = {
  extends: ['<xxx>'],
  // Other project-specific configurations, if necessary
};


This will set up ESLint to use the rules and configurations provided by this package.

Feel free to adjust the text as needed to better reflect the features and usage of your custom ESLint package.
